/*
    1. Create the following 2 functions:

    function ThisPerson(name, age, favouriteFood) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.favouriteFood = favouriteFood;
    }

    function ProtoPerson(name, age, favouriteFood) {
        return { // short-hand property initialization:
            name,
            age,
            favouriteFood,
        };
    }

    2. What is the difference between the following 2 instances?:
       const thisPerson = new ThisPerson("This", 0, "cookies");
       const protoPerson = ProtoPerson("Proto", 1, "?")

    3. How would you modify the ProtoPerson function to have it
       return the same thing as the ThisPerson function, but
       WITHOUT us having to use the "new" keyword still?

    *HINT: Think of how you'd modify/setup the prototype chain
