/*
    1. Create a new folder called "warmup"
    2. Inside of "warmup" create 2 files:
       - main.js
       - utils.js

    3. Inside of utils.js create a function called "capsLock"
       that takes a single parameter called "string" and RETURNS
       "string", but upper-cased

    4. Export "capsLock" as a NAMED export from utils.js
    
    5. Import "capsLock" inside main.js and call it with
       any string as an argument, then print the result.
       Run main.js using Node.

    HINT: Make sure to make a package.json file inside of
    "warmup" with this inside: { "type": "module" }
