/*
    1. Create a new folder called "exercise1"
    2. Inside of "exercise1" create 2 files:
       - main.js
       - utils.js

    3. Inside of utils.js create a function called "square"
       that takes a single parameter called "number" and RETURNS
       "number" squared (multiplied by itself).

    4. Also inside of utils.js, create a function called
       "greeting" that takes a single parameter called "name"
       and it simply prints out: `Hello ${name}!`

    5. Export "square" as a NAMED export from utils.js
    6. Export "greeting" as a DEFAULT export from utils.js
    
    5. Import both "square" and "greeting" on ONE line inside
       of main.js. Call both functions to make sure they work
       as expected. Run main.js using Node.

    HINT: Make sure to make a package.json file inside of
    "exercise1" with this inside: { "type": "module" }
