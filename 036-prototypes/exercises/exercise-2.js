    1. Create a new Object and assign it to a variable
       called "fakeArray". Give it the following value:
       { "0": "Zero", "1": "One", "2": "Two", length: 3}

    2. Set the prototype of "fakeArray" to be Array.prototype

    3. Use the map method on "fakeArray" to log out each item
       in the array.
