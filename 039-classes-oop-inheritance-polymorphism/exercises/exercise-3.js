/*
    1. Lookup the retro arcade game: Space Invaders
       on Google for some pictures
       Eg: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders

    2. How would you build a class to model the Player
       (Spaceship) and the Enemies (Flying Aliens)?
       * There are multiple different Aliens

    3. Try to think of all the different fields and
       methods each would have in a real game. What 
       would you want to have in them?

    4. Write these out first on paper/text to 
       brainstorm, then implement the classes in JS

    * This is purposefully open-ended to allow you
      the creative freedom to design these classes
