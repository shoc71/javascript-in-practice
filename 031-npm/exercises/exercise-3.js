/*
    1. Create a folder for this exercise called 'exercise3'
    2. Inside 'exercise3' run 'npm init' to create a default
       package.json file (press enter to skip answers)
    3. Add "type": "module" to the package.json so we can
       use es modules (import/export)

    4. Use NPM to install the "commander" package
    5. Create a file called "hello.js" and import { program }
       from commander (refer to the npm page or the docs as to how)
    6. Write code to allow us to run: node hello.js -n monkey
       Which will output: Hello, monkey!
       (-n will be a flag for the "name" argument which can be any
        single user-provided word)

    *This is challenging and requires a lot of trial and error and back
     and forth on NPM's website and this package's examples/docs
