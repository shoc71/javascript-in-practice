/*
    1. Create a variable called "points" that points at the Array:
       [3, 4, 1, 0, 1, 5, 6]

    2. Create a loop that loops over "points" and inside the loop use
       a switch statement that has these cases:
       - 0-2: print out only "Good try!"
       - 3-5: print out only "Very well done!"
       - Otherwise only print out "Wow, shooting for the moon!"

    3. Run the code and make sure the correct messages get printed out
