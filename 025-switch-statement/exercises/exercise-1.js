/*
    1. Create a variable called "activities" that points at the Array:
       ["Swimming", "Hiking", "Rock Climbing", "Biking", "Running"]

    2. Create a loop that loops over "activities" and inside the loop
       use a switch statement that has these cases:
       - "Swimming": only print out "Like a fish!"
       - "Rock Climbing": only print out "Like a mountain goat!"
       - "Running": only print out "Like a cheetah!"
       - Otherwise only print out "I'm sure some animal does that..."

    3. Run the code and make sure the correct messages get printed out
