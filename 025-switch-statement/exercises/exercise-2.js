/*
    1. Create a variable called "enemies" that points at the Object:
       {
        rat: { atk: 3, def: 2, hp: 20, class: 1 },
        goblin: { atk: 10, def: 6, hp: 50, class: 1 },
        troll: { atk: 30, def: 20, hp: 200, class: 2 },
        giant: { atk: 50, def: 40, hp: 500, class: 2 },
       }

    2. Create a loop that loops over "enemies" and inside the loop use
       a switch statement on the "class" property that has these cases:
       - 1: print out only "This is an easy fight"
       - 2: print out only "This will require some training"
       - Otherwise only print out "Not implemented yet..."

    3. Run the code and make sure the correct messages get printed out
