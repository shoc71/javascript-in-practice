/*
    1. Create a function called "createCounter" that has
       no parameters
    2. Inside "createCounter" create:
       - a variable called "counter" that starts at 0
       - a function called "incrementCounter" that increments
         the "counter" variable and then logs it out.
    3. Return "incrementCounter" from the "createCounter" function

    4. Test createCounter using different numbers like so:
       const counter = createCounter();
       counter(); // 1
       counter(); // 2
       counter(); // 3
       counter(); // 4

    * Why is this considered "closure"?
