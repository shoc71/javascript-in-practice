    General Advice:

    - You will get stuck! Embrace it and treat it as part of the process and learning
    - If you get stuck for too long, take a break or try another section of the program
      and come back later.
    - Google is your friend
    - Careful not to copy and paste code off the Internet - write it out yourself again
      and make sure you understand each line
    - Break down the problems in to smaller sub-problems and solve those as independently
      as you can
    - Have fun with it!
