/*
    1. Create a variable called "ages" that points to this array:
        [10, 42, 15, 22, 11, 74, 39, 2]

    2. Create an array called "results" that starts off empty

    3. Use a for-of loop to loop over "ages" and add an Object
       to "results" with an "age" key having the value of the "age" 
       being looped over. Also, add a "name" key that is always "Dragon".
       Eg: {age: 10, name: "Dragon"}, {age: 42, name: "Dragon"}

    4. Print out "results"

    5. "results" should be:
        [{age: 10, name: "Dragon"}, {age: 42, name: "Dragon"},
         {age: 15, name: "Dragon"}, {age: 22, name: "Dragon"},
         {age: 11, name: "Dragon"}, {age: 74, name: "Dragon"},
         {age: 39, name: "Dragon"}, {age: 2, name: "Dragon"}]
