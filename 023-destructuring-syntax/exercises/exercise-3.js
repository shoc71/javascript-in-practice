/*
    1. Create a function called "xyzCalc" that has a single
       parameter that is an Object. It expects to get that Object
       as an argument that looks like the following format:
       { x: 20, y: 2, z: 7 }

    2. The function will return the following calculation
       using x, y and z inside the Object:
          5 * x - 2 * y - z

    3. Call this function using the following Objects and
       make sure the results match:
       - xyzCalc({ x: 20, y: 2, z: 7 }) => 89
       - xyzCalc({ x: 2, y: 1, z: 20 }) => -12
       - xyzCalc({ x: 100, y: 100, z: 100 }) => 200

    4. Use destructuring inside the paramater list of the 
       "xyzCalc" to grab out the x, y and z values directly
       inside the function paramater list (as opposed to 
       inside the function body).

    5. Redo step 3 and make sure it still works
