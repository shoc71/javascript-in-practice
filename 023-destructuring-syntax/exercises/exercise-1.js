/*
  1. Create a variable called "snacks" that points to the Object:
        {
            chips: {name: "Pringles", salty: true},
            candy: {name: "Twizzlers", salty: false},
            chocolate: {name: "Mars", salty: false},
        } 

  2. Destructure out "candy" from "snacks" using the Objects
     destructuring syntax. Also destructure out the key
     "fruit" which will be set to a default value of:
     {name: "Banana", salty: false} if it doesn't exist inside
     of "snacks".
     
  3. Print out the variables pointing at the "candy" and "fruit" Objects
