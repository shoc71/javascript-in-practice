/*
    1. Create a variable called "store" that is a Map. Then add
       the following entries to the "store":
        - "Cups" with a value of 46
        - "Candles" with a value of 121
        - "Vases" with a value of 15

    2. Use a for...of loop to loop through "store" but inside
       the loop's (const ____ of ____) syntax, use destructuring
       to destructure out the key and value using Array style
       destructuring.
    
    3. Within the loop, print out the key and value on the
       same line seperated by a " => ". Eg: Cups => 46
       (The loop's body should only have one line of code)
