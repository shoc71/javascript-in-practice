/*
    1. Create a variable called "characters" that points at the array:
       ["Han Solo", "Spock", "Darth Vader", "Yoda", "Neo", "Sarah Connor"]

    2. Filter over "characters" to create a new array that does the following:
      - If the name has a space in it " ", keep it in the result (return true)
      - Otherwise, filter it out (return false)
      - Use a regular if/else statement for this
   
    3. Repeat step 2 but with a ternary expression

    BONUS: Can you shorten this with the short "arrow function
           expression" syntax?
