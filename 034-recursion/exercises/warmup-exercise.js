/*
    1. Create a function called "fizzbuzz" that takes two
       number arguments: "startNum" and "endNum"
    2. The function will count from "startNum" to the "endNum"
       incrementing by 1 each time and do the following:
    3. If the number is:
       - Divisible by 3: Print "Fizz" followed by the number
       - Divisible by 5: Print "Buzz" followed by the number
       - Divisible by both 3 AND 5:
         - Print "FizzBuzz" followed by the number (no fizz or buzz)
       - In all other cases, just print the number itself
        
    3. You must solve this using recursion
    4. Test it with different start and end values

    HINT: What is the base-case vs the "regular" cases here?
