/*
    1. Create a variable called "phoneNumber" that points at:
       the string: "020-382-6940"

    2. Create a regular expression called "phonePattern" that
       is a regular expression that would match a phone number
       with the format above in "phoneNumber" (including dashes)

    3. Test "phoneNumber" against "phonePattern" to see if
       it returns true/false using .test on "phonePattern"

    4. Find a match using .match on "phoneNumber" with the
       "phonePattern regex"

    5. Print out the results from 3 and 4.
