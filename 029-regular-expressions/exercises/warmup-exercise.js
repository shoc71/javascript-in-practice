    1. Create a variable called "quote" that points at:
       "What is this? A center for ants?"

    2. Create a variable called "pattern" that points at
       a regular expression to search for "ant" in a string

    3. Use the .test method on the "pattern" in step
       2 to check if "quote" has the pattern in it

    4. Use the .match method on the "quote" string to return
       a match for the "pattern" regexp

    5. Print out the results from steps 3 and 4
