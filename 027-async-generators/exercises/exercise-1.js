/*
    1. Create an async Generator function that has a 50%
       chance of yielding either of the following Promises:
       - Resolve after 500ms with the value "Fast!"
       - Resolve after 3000ms with the value "Slow!"

    2. Create the generator object by calling the function ^

    3. Use a for-await-of loop to loop through the generator
       indefinitely (ctrl-c to force exit the program)

    *HINT: Math.random() is your friend
