/*
    1. Create a variable called "superhero" that points at this Object:
        {   name: "Bruce Wayne", alias: "Batman", universe: "DC",
            happy: false, enemies: ["Joker", "Catwoman", "Bane"],
            bestMovie: {title: "The Dark Knight", rating: 95}   }

    2. How would you create a COPY of the Object pointed to by
       "superhero" INCLUDING COPIES of "enemies" and "bestMovie".

    3. Once you've created a total copy, modify the following:
       - add "Poison Ivy" to the copy's array of "enemies"
       - add { year: 2008 } to the copy's "bestMovie" Object

    4. Print out both "superhero" and it's copy to ensure that
       "superhero"'s "enemies" and "bestMovie" were NOT modified.

    *This can be done MANY different ways but is also quite challenging!
