/*
    1. Create a variable "book" that points at this Object:
       { name: "1984", author: "George Orwell", year: 1949,
         rating: 4.6, genre: "Science Fiction", movie: true }

    2. Create a Symbol.iterator property on "book" that will
       allow you to loop over it using a for-of-loop that will
       give you back the key-value pairs each loop as a paired
       array (similar to a Map): ["name", "1984"] ["rating", 4.6]

    3. Test your loop with a for-of-loop to make sure it works

    HINT: A generator function is the easiest way to do this
