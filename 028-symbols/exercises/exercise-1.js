    1. Create a variable "movie" that points at this Object:
       { name: "Blade Runner", director: "Ridley Scott",

    2. Add the two more properties to the "movie" Object:
       [Symbol("budget")]: 30
       [Symbol("boxOffice")]: 41.6

    3. Use a for-of loop to loop through all the entries inside
       "movie" and print out their key-value pairs:
       Eg: name => Blade Runner, director => Ridley Scott

    4. How would you access and print out the symbols in "movie"?
